# Zola-Windows Open Questions
Remaining Decisions-Locked items from `Zola_WINH00_MasterSynthesis.md`
Section 5, not yet resolved. Resolved items move to
`DESIGN_DECISIONS.md` and are removed from here. IDs match the master
synthesis document.

## Research needed (surfaced after Decisions Locked closed)
- **S13 — Windows-viable path to read the user's own incoming SMS.**
  See `DESIGN_DECISIONS.md` S13. Candidates to evaluate: Microsoft
  Phone Link (companion sync from a paired Android/iPhone), a
  Twilio-provisioned number (texts arrive at a Twilio number, not the
  user's personal number — different UX tradeoff), or another
  mechanism not yet identified. Needs research before it can be scoped
  into a build track. The `SMS On-Demand Query Path` pattern in
  `Zola_Sms_Intelligence_Architecture.md` (on-demand read/search/send,
  independent of the Daily Brief pipeline) is the likely v1 shape once
  an access path is found — not the full five-stage intelligence
  analyzer, which is deferred with the rest of the Daily Brief per S12.
*All Decisions Locked (Stage 2) items resolved — see DESIGN_DECISIONS.md. This file is now empty pending Stage 3 (Build Plan) discovery of new open questions, if any.*
